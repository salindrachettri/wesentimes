            <h2>A Rebel's Ink</h2>
            <p class="article-meta">By <strong>Kiron Chemsong</strong> • February 10, 2025</p>

            <p class="hook">my lover who’d been raped at your hands, to hold her hands I haven’t had the time in forty-four years</p>

            <p class="hook">I’ll have to remain alive</p>
            <p> <strong>A dull restraint, by Kabiranjan</strong>;
                <em>taken from the book “Ekhon nisxiddho atmojiiwoniir poraa”</em></p>
            <img src="https://i0.wp.com/raiot.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/100757710_263413424775177_8294107191795777536_n.jpg?resize=720%2C960&ssl=1" alt="Changemaker Image">
            <p>In the sun-kissed village of Khutikata, Nagaon nestled amidst the emerald brahmaputra river, Kabiranjan Saikia first opened his eyes to the world- a world that was still uder the arms of an oppressive regime, in 1975. Born as the only child to Renu and Hem Saikia, from his earliest days, Kabiranjan’s eyes were alight with curiosity and his heart brimming with love for his homeland- the land that birthed him. In the golden light of dawn, he would wander along the riverbanks, his tiny feet tracing patterns in the soft earth, his laughter mingling with the songs of birds. However, then little did many know about what he was destined for, since beneath this innocence, were the seeds of a soul destined for greatness, and a heart ablaze with the fervor of patriotism.</p>
            <p>Even as a child, Kabiranjan displayed a remarkable unmattched intellect and a passion for justice that belied his tender age. As a Class 5 student, his inquisitive mind eagerly absorbed the lessons of the world, and the tales of the assamese & wesean resilience, against foreign rule. Then he spoke about the beauty of Bohag, glorified the
                spirit embodied by the likes of Lachit Borphukan and Joymoti and dreamt of becoming a great
                personality. His teachers at school too, marveled at his insatiable thirst for knowledge and his
                passion for writing. It was then, during these formative years that Kabiranjan's pen first dipped
                into the ink of what awaited him, weaving the tales of bravery and defiance that captured the
                hearts of all who read them. At the tender age of twelve, he penned his first eye-catching piece,
                “Aai matri Assam” a poignant reflection on the beauty of his beloved Assam, infused with the
                spirit of a poet wise beyond his years. It was not merely ink on paper; it was a mirror reflecting
                the turmoil of a soul torn by the conflicts of existence. Humanity and inner turmoil intertwined in
                his verses, each word a reflecting his later years as a poet trapped in a patriot’s body</p>
            <p>As the years unfurled like petals in the wind, this child’s dreams grew wings, soaring high above the emerald canopy of his childhood home, Wesea & Assam. He stood as a voice for the voiceless, championing the cause of the oppressed and downtrodden with unwavering determination. It was during these days that ULFA or the United Liberation Front of Assam, was at its peak, as the outfit demanded, “Swadhin Axom” or Independent Assam. These sentiments at that point, was widely popular among the assamese as well as northeastern natives, as they felt that India was treating Assam, and the wider northeast, as a colony for resources. This step motherly treatment was also evident, as India began settling in Bengali immigrants following the Bangladeshi liberation war, threating the identity of the masses in the region. Many assamese organisations got involved, including various student bodies, and this is what birthed the extremist ULFA. With each year, and each assault on the people of the northeast, by the Indian Armed forces- that was known for its brutality and and for targetting random civillians, the young Kabiranjan’s struggle against oppression and his love for his motherland, brought him increasingly close to this armed struggle. However, what many don’t know is that this child was neither a soldier nor one who called for a military solution. Despite the prevailing climate of fear and silence surrounding the ULFA, Kabiranjan exhibited an unparalleled spirit of courage and defiance. He penned an article in Ganatantra, sharply critical of the outfit, during a time when the mere mention of dissent against the ULFA was met with trepidation. In the year 1991, amidst the echoes of dissent, he took to the streets, bearing black flags in protest against the visit of the Governor of Assam to Nagaon. This was also a time, when religious turmoil was at its peak in India, when Hindu Nationalists had demolished the controversial Babri Majid. Kabiranjan however did not remain silent then. In the hallowed pages of Assam's premier journal, Prantik, he penned his words, advocating not for the desecration of mosques, but for the construction of temples in the form of hospitals. In his vision, true temples would stand as bastions of healing, serving the needs of both Muslim and Hindu alike. When his uncle confronted him, wielding a menacing stick, questioning the authorship of the articles he claimed as his own, Kabiranjan's resolve only grew stronger. Rather than succumbing to intimidation, he found renewed determination to amplify his voice. At this point, Kabirajan was merely in middle school, but yet had a clear vision for the future of Assam, and Wesea as a whole. His dream was to one day set up the largest library in Northeast, and ensuring that the next generation of pioneers came from this soil. He also actively pushed for brotherhood among various religious and ethnicities of Wesea</p>
            <p>Behind this every stroke of his pen and the quiet corners of their home, his words found flight,
                carried forth by the hands of familial love and solidarity. Within the sanctum of his family,
                judgment found no harbor, for they recognized in Kabiranjan a soul guided by principles, and
                urtured by virtue, for they raised him not merely to abide by the dictates of society, but to stand
                resolute in the pursuit of what was right, what was just.</p>
                <p>However, with every step he took towards freedom, Kabiranjan found himself increasingly
                    ensnared in the growing web of conflict and turmoil that plagued his beloved land. The tag of
                    being an "over-ground worker of Ulfa" was thrust upon him, branding him as a pariah in the eyes
                    of those who sought to silence the voices of dissent. In 1993 while completing his BA from
                    Nagaon College, he had formally joined the Manab Adhikar Sangram Samity, an organisation
                    formed by the journalists of Assam, to protect and promote of human rights both civil and
                    political. It was also one of the few organisations, that had challenged the alleged human rights
                    violations in Assam by the Indian Army, paramilitary forces and state police. It was maybe due
                    to this, that the Indian Government had declared him an ULFA member in the very same year.
                    This rather than deterring Kabiranjan, further pushed him to join the outfit, and also rose up the
                    ranks to be the, “Assistant Publicity Secretary”. During this time with the outfit, he wrote
                    countless pieces, inspiring wesean and assamese nationalism, alongside also sharing his
                    stories of spending countless sleepless nights in the jungles or taking shelter in unknown homes
                    around assam, as he avoided being caught by the authorities of the Government of India. It was
                    he, who had also taken the initiative to work and develop, the ULFA mouthpiece, “Swadintha”,
                    as he spoke against the injustices the people of wesea faced under India. Even though, he
                    never called for violence, and was strongly against any form of bloodshed, be became a top
                    target for India- a person who had to be eliminated, executed and silenced at all cost. Death
                    therefore loomed close to him.
                    </p>
                    <p>During this period, was when Kabiranjan Saikia assumed the alias of “Swadhinata Phukon”,
                        emblematic of his commitment to the cause of liberation. Tragically however, it was on the
                        fateful night of May 26, 2000, that his life was abruptly extinguished, denied the fundamental
                        right to a fair trial, thereby flagrantly contravening established norms of international human
                        rights law as well as domestic statutes safeguarding the rights of individuals.</p>
                        <p>During the time of the death, Kabiranjan was taking refuge in the official quarter of a lady doctor,
                            and was apprehended by the police, blindfolded and handcuffed, before being whisked away
                            and shot point blank, at the orders of district Superintendent of Police, Sri G P Singh, a man
                            known to have killed countless civillians including children- yet he was never charged by the
                            Indian machinary. Witnesses attest that in the final moments before his life was unjustly
                            extinguished, Saikia met the gaze of those who sought to silence him, defiantly proclaiming his
                            innocence and reaffirming his unyielding commitment to the cause he believed in. Despite the
                            imminent threat to his life and the overwhelming odds stacked against him, Saikia's spirit
                            remained unbroken, his resolve undiminished by the specter of death looming large. Even after
                            extinguishing his life, the government of India, through the hastened cremation of Phukon's
                            mortal remains by the Nagaon district administration, sought to erase any lingering traces of his
                            existence. The lack of customary rites and observances surrounding his cremation, of the hindu faith that he belonged to, underscores the palpable apprehension gripping the authorities,
                            revealing their fear of the simmering discontent among the masses and their desperate attempt
                            to quell any potential unrest. This hurried disposal of his remains serves as a stark reminder of
                            the lengths to which those in power will go to suppress dissent and silence voices of opposition.
                            It speaks volumes about the prevailing atmosphere of fear and intimidation, where even in
                            death, individuals like Phukon are denied the dignity and respect they deserve.</p>
                <p>At first, the government of India, also tried, projecting Saikia as nothing but a mere
                    terrorist/mafia head, by propagating a narrative asserts that he met his end in an encounter,
                    wherein he purportedly opened fire upon a security patrol that intercepted him while he was
                    traversing on a bicycle. However, such assertions face stark challenge from the local populace,
                    as well as the evidences that emerged later on to contest the official version vehemently. This
                    was also proven, by the council set up by the late chief minister Tarun Gogoi- however even
                    after that later on, the government in New Delhi, declared any investigations into the case as
                    illegal.
                    </p>
                <p>The way Saikia was killed, goes on to violate every law of basic human rights, enchrined by
                    international bodies like the UN. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a seminal
                    document enshrinies the inalienable rights of all human beings, unequivocally affirms the right to
                    life, liberty, and security of person (Article 3). Additionally, it upholds the principle of equality
                    before the law, emphasizing the right to a fair and public hearing by an impartial tribunal in the
                    determination of one's rights and obligations (Article 10). If India, truly claims Weseans as
                    Indians, and not as secondary subjects, then too, many rights underlined by the indian
                    constitution was denied to Saikia. For instance, in India, the Constitution guarantees the right to
                    life and personal liberty under Article 21, thereby obligating the State to uphold these rights and
                    ensure that no person is deprived of life or personal liberty except in accordance with the
                    procedure established by law. Kabiranjan’s death therefore, epitomizes the grim reality of
                    extrajudicial executions plaguing regions marred by insurgency.
                    </p>
            <p>Despite the efforts of the government of India to erase his memory, Phukon's legacy continues
                to live on in the hearts of every wesean and every assamese, serving as a rallying cry for those
                who continue to fight against injustice and oppression of indigenous communities around the
                world.</p>

                <p>In Saikia’s own words in his poem Kiman Xomoi Teo Nirobe Kotaisil Prarthonagharat (How
                    much time he spent in solitude in the prayer room), he quoted <strong>“Everybody thinks that we
                        revolutionaries live without emotion/that is why those who pretend taking advantage of our
                        simplicity/and wish for our painful days/never regret”</strong> </p>
